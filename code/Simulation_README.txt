The "Simulation" folder contains two subdirectories: "Univariate" and "Multivariate".

* The folder named "Univariate" contains R codes for the univariate model. 
- The R file named "uni_function.R" contains the R codes used in simulations for the univariate cases (IVX-AR by AIC and BIC, IVX-KMS, data generating processes);
- The R file named "univariate_size_tables.R" replicates Tables 1-2 in the main text;
- The R file named "univariate_power_plots.R" replicates Figures 1-3 in the main text.

* The folder named "Multivariate" contains R codes for the multivariate model. 
- The R file named "multi_function.R" contains the R codes used in simulations for the multivariate cases (IVX-AR by AIC and BIC, IVX-KMS, data generating processes);
- The R file named "multivariate_size_tables.R" replicates Table 3 in the main text;
- The R file named "multivariate_power_plots.R" replicates Figure 4 in the main text.
